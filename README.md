# SampleBrowser2
Rewritten Sample Browser with movable panes

This is a minor update of the master branch, to take care of compiler errors resulting from changes to the JUCE 6 API, most of which in turn have to do with JUCE now following guidelines set forth by the C++17 standard.

The Projucer project was also updated to follow the common practice of supporting the latest OS and tools, excepting macOS where the next-most-current release is generally the target (in this case macOS 10.15 aka Catalina).
